# Note Taker
An application to log, save, and delete notes

## Author

## User Story
<p>"I need a application in order to save notes I take throughout out the day. The application needs to order the notes in order I saved them. I should click on a past note and see the notes title and body text.
</p>

## Functionality
The user is first presented with a nice clean homepage asking to get started taking notes.
Next, the user is presented with the notes on the left side of the screen and a writing pad in the center.
If the user doesn't fill in either the title or the text body, it will not allow you to save the respected note.
Once the user creates a new note, it automatically gets saved into the notes list and generates the note to be accessed again in the future.
